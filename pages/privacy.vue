    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY, APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <p>The Corporation for Digital Scholarship ("CDS", us", "we" or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who use the Sourcery website, application and technology platform (collectively, the "Sourcery Platform").  This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is designed to assist users of the Sourcery Platform ("user", "you" or "your") in understanding how we collect, use, share, retain, safeguard, and dispose of the information you provide to us and in making informed decisions when using the Sourcery Platform.</p>

    <h3>Application</h3>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Sourcery Platform and governs data collection and usage on the Sourcery Platform.  The United States has data protection laws that may not be consistent with those of other countries.  If you are a natural person located in the European Union or European Economic Area, the terms of our <a href="/addendum.pdf">EU/EEA Privacy Policy Addendum</a> incorporated herein by reference, will apply to you to the extent required under applicable law. Where the General Data Protection Regulation applies to our processing of your personal data, the EU/EEA Privacy Policy Addendum will govern to the extent of any inconsistency between the EU/EEA Privacy Policy Addendum and this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>Acceptance</h3>

    <p>By accessing, browsing and/or using the Sourcery Platform, including all content, software, functions, services, materials and information made available on or accessed through the Sourcery Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.  Any information provided by or through the Sourcery Platform will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  By using the Sourcery Platform, you consent to the processing of data about you in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.  Please read it in its entirety.  Beyond this Privacy Policy, your use of the Sourcery Platform is also subject to our Terms of Use, our Cookie Policy, and, if applicable, the EU/EEA Privacy Policy Addendum.</p>

    <h2>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <h3>Information Provided By You</h3>

    <p>In order for you to register as a user and access certain portions of our Sourcery Platform and/or participate in certain services, and if you communicate with us by e-mail or otherwise complete online forms or the like, we may require you to provide us with information that personally identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address and home and/or business telephone numbers, bank account number, credit card or debit card number, as well as any account number that we assign to you ("Personal Information") which may be retained and used by us as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>When you add a credit card or payment method to your Sourcery account, a third party handles payments for us and will receive your credit card information.  To keep your financial data secure, we do not store credit card information on our servers.</p>

    <p>You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information.  In such an event, you will not be able to access or use those portions of the Sourcery Platform or participate in certain online activities or services that require your Personal Information.  You may still use the Sourcery Platform to browse information about the Sourcery Platform and related services.</p>

    <h3>Information Collected By Us</h3>

    <p>Through the use of cookie technology or otherwise, we may track and collect information about your computer, devices and software when you visit the Sourcery Platform.  This information may include: (i) your IP address; (ii) IP demographics (location, language, country of origin, etc.); (iii) domain server; (iv) type of computer; (v) type of web browser; (vi) access times; and (vii) referring web sites addresses (collectively "Traffic Data").  We do not use Traffic Data to identify you specifically, but rather to keep track of various aggregated analytics related to use of the Sourcery Platform.  Traffic Data assists us to design and arrange our applications and web pages in the user-friendliest manner and to continually improve our Sourcery Platform to better meet the needs of users.</p>

    <p>In order to connect registered users who act as "Clients" and "Sourcerers", as those terms are defined in our Terms of Use, we need to know where you are located. When you access the Sourcery Platform on your mobile or other device or computer, and register as a user, we receive your location. We may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We receive information from users’ devices, including IP address, web browser type, mobile operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens.</p>

    <p>Clients and Sourcerers may have the opportunity to rate each other at the end of every completed job using a numerical, star-based, or similar rating system. We receive information about ratings and, as we explain below, give Clients information about Sourcerers’ ratings and vice versa.</p>

    <h2>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h2>

    <p>We collect information about you in the following ways.</p>

    <p>We collect information about you through the information you provide to us directly.  We also collect certain information about you and your Sourcery Platform activities through the use of various technologies described below.</p>

    We employ cookie technology to store and sometimes track information about the users of the Sourcery Platform.  Please refer to our Cookie Policy for information on how we use cookies and how to manage and store cookies used on our website.

    <h2>WHAT WE DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or any agreements you enter into with CDS, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and the like, or legal process served on us; (b) provide you the products, services and/or information that you have requested; (c) protect our rights and/or property; (d) enforce our rights; (e) protect the interests of other users of the Sourcery Platform or any other person; (f) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of our equipment; and/or (g) detect, prevent and/or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, as authorized by law.</p>

    <p>In general, we will use Personal Information only for the purpose for which such information was provided to us, such as connecting Clients and Sourcerers, facilitating transactions and payments, and notifying Researchers about job demands, pricing and service updates.  We may also use Personal Information (a) to verify the information you provided to us; (b) to provide you with the information that you have requested; (c) to respond to your inquiries; (d) to contact you when necessary; and (e) to send you information about us, including information related to our products, services, programs or promotional activities, or about third-party products, services, programs or promotional activities that may be of interest to you.  In the case of third-party products, services, programs or promotional activities, your Personal Information is not transferred to the third party.  If you sign up or subscribe to our newsletter(s) or publications, we will use your name and e-mail address to send the newsletter(s) or publications to you.</p>

    <p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties that provide services to us (including, handling and delivering of e-mail communications and publications, payment processing, user submitted information processing and/or storage, and web site hosting) as reasonably necessary for them to provide those services.  Our service providers who have access to Personal Information, however, are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and not to use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.</p>

    <p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze trends, administer the Sourcery Platform, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We may provide Traffic Data and/or other aggregate non-personally identifying information to third parties.</p>

    <p>We may share basic Personal Information between Clients and Sourcerers who have been matched with one another, such as usernames and ratings.  Clients see a Sourcerer’s current location at the time they are matched. Although we help Clients and Researchers communicate with one another to arrange a job, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users, even if you have been matched with them.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may transfer, sell or assign information concerning the Sourcery Platform and your use of the Sourcery Platform, including without limitation, Personal Information, to third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, or reorganization or liquidation of us.</p>

    <h2>WHAT WE DO NOT DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <p>We do not use the information we collect from or about you through your use of the Sourcery Platform except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.  To be clear, we do not sell your Personal Information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <p>The Sourcery Platform has security measures in place intended to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard against unauthorized access or disclosure, and accidental loss or alteration, of the Personal Information we collect.  As an additional security measure, your Personal Information is encrypted during transmission by Secure Socket Layer 256 bit encryption software.  Encryption is a common method used to transmit sensitive data across the Internet.  Encryption temporarily makes the text unreadable during the time it is being transmitted over the Internet.  Please note, that for encryption to work, your browser must support at least this level of compatibility.  Not all versions of all browsers have 256-bit encryption capability, so you may need to download an upgrade to receive encryption.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our Sourcery Platform, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems.</p>

    <p>In the event that there is ever a breach of security regarding your Personal Information, we intend to comply with applicable state and federal law requirements regarding notification and disclosure to you and to the appropriate authorities of the circumstances surrounding the breach.</p>

    <h2>THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</h2>

    <p>This Sourcery Platform may contain links to third party service providers and third party web sites.  These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us of the contents on those sites.  For example, our payment processor is a third party and we provide the link to that processor for your convenience in completing a payment transaction.</p>

    <p>If you access any third-party web site links, you will leave the Sourcery Platform.  We do not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from our practices.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of linked third party sites.  We do not make any warranty or representation regarding, nor do we endorse, any linked third-party web sites or the information or content appearing thereon or any of the products or services described thereon, or the accuracy of the same.  The personal information you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any third-party before submitting your personal information.  If you decide to access linked third party web sites, you do so at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13; NOTICE TO PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS</h2>

    <p>We are committed to protecting the on-line privacy of children – that is, individuals under 13 years of age ("Child" or "Children").  In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly collect any Personal Information from or provide any services or products to Children.</p>

    <h2>OPT-OUT/DISCONTINUE</h2>

    <p>If you sign up/subscribe to our newsletter(s) or other publications (if any) and you no longer wish to receive the same, you may also unsubscribe by following the opt-out/unsubscribe link located within each newsletter or other publication.</p>

    <p>When you register with the Sourcery Platform, you may receive a message on your device asking you if you desire to receive push notifications from CDS. You can decline to receive push notifications or later opt out of receiving push notifications through your device settings. Please note that declining to receive push notifications or later opting out of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Sourcery Platform (such as receiving a notification that your job request has been completed).</p>
    <p>While you can prevent your device from sharing location information at any time through your device’s operating system settings, Sourcerer location is a core element of the Sourcery Platform and without it you will be unable to be matched with Clients.</p>

    <h2>CORRECTIONS; UPDATES</h2>

    <p>If you wish to change or modify information previously provided to us, you may do so by sending us an e-mail at <a :href="`mailto:${sourceryEmail}`">{{ sourceryEmail }}</a> We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is corrected or updated in our records.</p>

    <p>You can also review and edit certain account information by logging in to your account settings and profile. If would like to terminate your Sourcery account, please contact us at <a :href="`mailto:${sourceryEmail}`">{{ sourceryEmail }}</a> with your request. If you choose to terminate your account, we will deactivate it for you in accordance with our Terms of Use, but may retain information from your account for a certain period of time and disclose it in a manner consistent with our practices under this Privacy Policy for accounts that are not closed.</p>

    <h2>RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

    <p>We generally retain your Personal Information only for so long as needed to provide the services requested by you (including the Sourcery Platform), to comply with our legal obligations, and/or to address potential or actual claims or actions.</p>

    <h2>METHOD OF DISPOSAL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

    <p>We dispose of Personal Information securely and safely.  Prior to disposal, we destroy, erase or make unreadable any data, computer files or documents containing your Personal Information in a manner that protects their confidentiality.</p>

    <h2>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h2>

    <p>We may change our Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting.  Changes to our Privacy Policy will be effective when posted and the new effective date will be identified.  We also will post a notice on the homepage of our Sourcery Platform for a period of 30 days from the posting of the revised Privacy Policy, indicating that our Privacy Policy has changed.  If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, those changes likewise will be included in an updated posting of this Privacy Policy with a corresponding 30 day posting of a notice of the revised Privacy Policy.  In addition, with regard to changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will send an email to users of the Sourcery Platform who have provided us with an email address, notifying them of such changes.  Your continued use of the Sourcery Platform signifies assent to these changes.</p>

    <h2>CONTACT US</h2>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy or any questions about the security at our Sourcery Platform, you can contact us by e-mail at <a :href="`mailto:${sourceryEmail}`">{{ sourceryEmail }}</a>.</p>
